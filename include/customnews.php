   Ok, apparently we had a security breach again on Scene.org, and the RBN got through the defense lines.
   On April 11 someone from the RBN's IP range touched Pouet's index.php again, but this time we didn't
   notice a change, so hopefully they screwed something up on their side. (Or maybe the Pouet code is
   really THAT contrived that they gave up, eheh.)
   <br/><br/>
   Our hosting university in Rotterdam has been constantly working on blocking the RBN's IP ranges, but
   obviously as they are on the initiative side, they can always be a step ahead.
   We also obviously changed any involved passwords and checked the access IP's whether they touched anything else,
   and the only other site involved was pain.scene.org, which we also cleaned up.
   At the time of writing, everything seems to be safe and sound, and we're keeping an eye out.

   To be on the safe side, make sure your computer is clean, check the <a href="topic.php?which=5006&page=2">thread</a> for some tips.
